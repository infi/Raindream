# Raindream, the C# Daydream Clone  
  
Raindream is a bot loosely based on my bot [Daydream](https://git.geist.ga/infi/daydream).    
  
## Build  
  
`dotnet build`

### Now, Run
  
`dotnet run`
  
## Addendum

No Database server required, I don't have any database.  
  
The functionality is very lacking.  
  
This might be the first Daydream clone to feature a web interface but don't quote me on that one.
